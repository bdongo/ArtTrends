Functionality of my project, Art and Trends, is to visualize image data. My main functionality is to have the user interact with an array of pictures that expand where the user is hovering.




__In Fashion and Trends, users will be able to:__

-Scrolling and and enlarging while mouse is hovering over a picture

-Abstraction of image set to move past on top bar

-A menu to access each page

In addition, this project will include:

__Friday Afternoon & Weekend:__
Friday and the weekend will be to nail down the visual layout of my project. I would like my html, css and static elements as finalized as possible before I move onto problem solving the dynamic elements. I will also create and Art Object class to make them uniform in attributes, if I am pulling them from different APIs.
The goal over the weekend is to familiarize myself with new tools, mainly D3 to try and a get a start of the mockup of the main hovering scroll feature of the project.
